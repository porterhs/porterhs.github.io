        <p data-scroll data-scroll-speed="2" data-scroll-delay="0.2">Dozer Incorporated is one of the many specialized companies stemming from Spartan Robotics Incorporated. Dozer is a diverse group of engineers, who have designed a robot, Rubble, capable of performing controlled, safe demolition. Rubble's goal is to effectively demolish and relocate rubble and debris without jeopardizing withstanding ecosystems and the surrounding populous. As a company devoted to the safety of the environment and community, we promise to adequately fulfill the tasks and responsibilities that accompany demolition.</p>

        <h2>Rubble<br>When being presented with a new challenge by the officials at BEST Robotics Inc, the engineers of Spartan Robotics Incorporated began to create a solution that would be capable of successfully performing the tasks that were required by the Demo Daze challenges. We introduce you to Rubble, a demolition robot featuring several functions used to demolish any building safely and responsibly.</h2>

        <h2>Brainstorming<br></br>Dozer's team of engineers had to develop and apply an elaborate engineering design process to create Rubble, which will be able to fulfill its needed jobs while being eco-friendly and incredibly efficient in the process. They were able to secure the effective completion of each component of our robotic solution by applying the necessary knowledge and creativity during the process.</h2>
							<h2>Prototyping<br></br>During the Prototyping phase of our design process, we used various types of different concepts to test which ones worked cohesively and effectively. We used cardboard cutouts of our designs to test out how our mechanisms would work and how we would assemble them. One of the prototypes we designed was the claw, which showed us how we needed to assemble our mechanism and how it worked. We also created a somewhat to scale model of our lift and we used that as the basis for our final design. Recently we changed one of the parts of our claw which massively improved our design and allowed us to safely transfer debris and rubble.</h2>
